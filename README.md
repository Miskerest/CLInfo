# CLInfo

This is a simple Pyton/Bash script that grabs various information such as weather, system info, and the current time, outputs it in a cycle through stdout.

It utilizes a slightly modified version of py-ascii-digital-clock by *htmk*, available here: https://github.com/htmk/py-ascii-digital-clock

It also grabs the current weather from wttr.in, so kudos to whoever made that gem of a site.

Updates and added features to come!
